# Data WareHouse Project (Data Engineering & Analytics)

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a data warehouse that consolidates data from multiple sources, processes it using ETL workflows, and provides a reliable foundation for reporting and analytics.

---

## ðŸš€ Overview

The goal of this project is to centralize enterprise data, ensure consistency, and support decision-making through efficient querying, dashboards, and business intelligence.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Objectives

- Collect and integrate data from multiple heterogeneous sources  
- Apply ETL processes to clean, transform, and standardize data  
- Implement dimensional modeling (star/snowflake schema)  
- Provide optimized performance for analytical queries and reporting  
- Enable BI tools and dashboards for data-driven insights

## ðŸ§° Technologies & Tools

| Layer | Technology / Tool |
|---|---|
| Data ingestion / ETL | Python, SQL, or ETL tools (Airflow, SSIS, etc.) |
| Storage & Staging | Relational DBMS (PostgreSQL, MS SQL Server, etc.) |
| Data Warehouse | Snowflake, Redshift, or SQL Server |
| BI / Visualization | Power BI, Tableau, or Looker |

## ðŸ“‚ Architecture

1. **Source Systems** â€” Raw data from databases, files, and APIs  
2. **Staging Area** â€” Temporary storage for extracted raw data  
3. **Transformations** â€” Cleaning, joining, deduplication, business rules  
4. **Data Warehouse** â€” Fact and dimension tables modeled in star/snowflake schema  
5. **Analytics Layer** â€” BI dashboards, reports, and ad hoc queries
